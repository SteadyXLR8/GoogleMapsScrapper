# Google Maps Scraping Project (Python, Selenium & Pandas)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Google Maps Scraping Project** is a Python-based tool that automates the extraction of business and location data from Google Maps. Using **Selenium** for web automation and **Pandas** for data processing, this project enables users to collect valuable business insights, including names, addresses, phone numbers, ratings, and reviews. The extracted data can be used for market research, lead generation, and competitive analysis.

## 🎯 Features
- **Automated Data Extraction:**
  - Business Name
  - Address
  - Phone Number
  - Website URL
  - Ratings & Reviews
  - Opening Hours
  - Business Category
- **Search Query Input:** Define search parameters (e.g., "coffee shops in New York").
- **Data Processing & Storage:**
  - Uses **Pandas** to clean, filter, and structure data.
  - Exports results to **CSV, JSON**, or stores them in an **SQLite/PostgreSQL database**.
- **Error Handling & Anti-Detection Measures:**
  - Implements **randomized delays, user-agent rotation,** and **headless browsing**.
- **Data Visualization (Optional):** Generate summary insights using **Matplotlib/Seaborn**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Selenium** – Web automation for navigating Google Maps
- **Pandas** – Data processing and analysis
- **BeautifulSoup (Optional)** – Parsing extracted HTML content
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL (Optional)** – Storing structured data

## ⚠️ Challenges & Considerations
- **Google’s Anti-Scraping Policies:** Google actively prevents automated data collection, so techniques like **randomized delays and proxy usage** are necessary.
- **Performance Optimization:** Running **Selenium** efficiently while extracting large datasets.
- **Legal & Ethical Compliance:** Respect **Google’s terms of service** and explore **API-based alternatives** when necessary.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
